hey! mad-lad! this is for changing files outside of scratch so.. have fun!
also, you may want to put all of these files in the same folder instead of seperate ones =|

Building:

Well...Not really building but whatever!

First archive all of the files as a .sb3 file
then just use "https://packager.turbowarp.org/" to package the game and tweak some variables to your liking!
Congrats!
